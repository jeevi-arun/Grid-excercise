Built a Grid layout using Tailwind CSS Grid to strengthen my understanding of modern CSS layout systems. This mini project helped me explore:

ðŸ”¹ Grid-based responsive design
ðŸ”¹ Column and row spans using utility classes

This hands-on practice improved my layout planning, and it was a great step in mastering Tailwind CSS for real-world projects.

Tools Used:

ðŸ”§ HTML, Tailwind CSSâ€‹
